MATHEMATICS lesson by Antonello Mincone


For all those who aspire to make games like DOOM, ELITE, or any other
game that requires the use of polygons, or even one of the
effects that has now become standard in DEMOS, namely texture mapping,
I believe it is essential to know some of the basic mathematical formulas,
 particularly those related to analytical geometry and trigonometry
.
If you never understood these topics at school, or simply never encountered them
and have always heard them described as incredibly
complicated, I can assure you that this is absolutely not true.The real difficulty lies in following the subject carefully, but above all in understanding it.
In practice, my advice is to do (based on the knowledge you have) a little at a time, both with this lesson and with the course in general, given that you can actually own all the computer science and mathematics books in the world, but these only constitute the essential
basis (but not sufficient) for writing a valid programme: you become good mainly through experience, trying and retrying the routines, modifying them, in short, experimenting.

.
Based on this, I have decided to write this article not to teach you a particular
3D technique (also because there is a specific lesson for that), but the
basics that will allow you to work out the formulas for yourselves, even if only to create 
a pre-calculated table suited to your needs.
I will therefore start from scratch (well, not quite, since I hope you know the four
basic operations, otherwise you should not be taking this course but elementary school), so do not be surprised if you already know the subject
and perhaps have something to object to about my style of presentation.
First of all, let's talk about what experts in the field call the “ORTHOGONAL CARTESIAN REFERENCE SYSTEM”.
First of all, let's talk about what experts in the field call the 
“ORTHOGONAL CARTESIAN REFERENCE SYSTEM”. In reality, this name
hides something very simple:
 two common straight lines (a line with no beginning and no end is called a STRAIGHT LINE, a line with a beginning but no end is called a SEMI-STRAIGHT LINE, and a line with a beginning and an end is called a SEGMENT)
arranged so that, when crossed, they form four 90-degree angles,
which are conventionally named X and Y.
In practice, they are arranged as follows: 
The point O corresponds to the intersection of the axes and is called the ORIGIN.




                           ^
                         Y |

                           |
                           |
              -------------+-------------------->
                          O|                   X
                           |
                           |
                           |
                           |
                           |
                           |
                           
                        



Point O corresponds to the intersection of the axes and is called the ORIGIN.
The X and Y axes are called the abscissa axis and the ordinate axis, respectively,
 and are used to give us references to each point, which are obtained by 
drawing a line parallel to the X axis and a line parallel to the Y axis, which in practice tell us
the height of the point with respect to X and its distance from Y, which we will express
by choosing a unit of measurement and seeing how many times this unit fits into the
measurement in question: when we want to indicate where a certain point is located,
 we should define its distance from the X-axis and the Y-axis (more
precisely, its ordinate and its abscissa). Let's imagine, for example, that we have 
a point P :



                              ^     
                            Y |
                              |
                              |  x1  
                              |-----.P
                              |     |
                              |     |y1
                              |     |
                --------------+------------------>
                             O|                 X
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              



The segment marked with x1 indicates its abscissa, while the segment marked with y1 indicates its ordinate.
We will omit the unit of measurement since with AMIGA you will be using pixels.
Please note that when the point is to the right of the Y axis, the abscissa is positive (i.e. greater than 0), while when it is to the left, it is negative (i.e. less than 0).
Note that when the point is to the right of the Y-axis, the abscissa is positive
(i.e. greater than 0), while when it is to the left, it is negative
(i.e. less than 0); in the extreme case, when it is on the Y-axis, it will be
equal to 0.
The same applies to the X axis: when the point is above it, the ordinate is positive, below it is negative, and on the X axis it is 0. 
However, if we relate this to reality, we realise that two dimensions are not
sufficient, since all objects have, in addition to a width and
a height, also a depth.
We therefore need a third dimension, namely depth, which allows us to relate even a single 
point to space. A graph that gives us a complete picture of an
object in space will therefore look like this:

		
				^
			  Y	|

				|        /
       			|     P / z1

	  Z /
	       	

The new axis, Z, indicates the new dimension.It should be noted that, in 
space, the angle between the X axis and the Z axis and that between the Y axis and the 
Z axis is a right angle, i.e. 90 degrees, which unfortunately becomes distorted in
axonometric projection (which is precisely the projection used to represent all graphs
. 
So far, we have only talked about points, while the space around us is made up
of much more complex objects, which are generally made up of lines that connect
the edges that define them. It is often necessary to represent
curved objects, such as simple circles or more complex curves, determined
by complicated trigonometric formulas:
 in these cases, with the AMIGA, I always recommend reducing the curve to a polygon, even with 20 sides, but
this is certainly faster to draw and calculate in rotations or translations
(movements that only involve displacement). However, at the
end of the lesson, you will find the formulas for the most important curves.
To join the points of the polygons, you can generally use the LI-
NE function of the blitter, but this is not always the fastest, and it may be necessary to
entrust this work to the processor: it is therefore useful to know the 
main formulas related to drawing straight lines.
Let's start by saying that every straight line is identified on the Cartesian axes by the formula
:
Y = m*X + q

This formula gives us the ordinates of all the points on the line according to
its abscissa; in short, just replace x with any value to
obtain the corresponding y of the line. The terms m and q that appear in the 
formula are constants: the first m is called the angular coefficient and determines-
the angle that the line forms with the X axis (more precisely, it is the tangent
of that angle, but we will discuss this topic later). The larger 
m is, the larger the angle formed will be. q determines the point where
the line intersects the y axis, essentially the point on the line that has coordinates:
(0,q). From this, it is easy to see that if q=0, then the line passes through the origin
of the axes.
There is also a formula that I believe is very important for creating a 3D programme
. Given a point P1 with coordinates (P1x,P1y) and a point P2 with coordinates
 
(P2x,P2y), we can obtain the line passing through these two points with the formula
:

Y-P1y = (P2y-P1y)/(P2x-P1x)*(X-P1x)

From this formula, we obtain:

Y = (P2y-P1y)/(P2x-P1x)*X + (-P1x*(P2y-P1y)/(P2x-P1x))+P1y

This is precisely the formula of the straight line passing through the points taken into consideration.
 The term that appears before the X corresponds to m, while the entire 
formula that appears after it would be q, but of course this calculation 
will only be done once for each straight line. Applications of the same formula 
can be useful, for example, for a line that exits the screen: given the 
endpoints of this line, we can find the formula that determines it and then, substituting
the abscissa of the edges of the screen for X, we can find the coordinates
of the endpoints of the visible segment.

Other formulas that are often useful when knowing the coordinates of two points
P1 (P1x,P1y) and P2 (P2x,P2y) are:

1) The one for finding their distance (which is basically an application of the 
Pythagorean theorem, which you will find later):

distance = sqr((P2x-P1x)^2+(P2y-P1y)^2)

(sqr is simply the instruction used by most high-level languages
to indicate the square root, while the symbol ^ means e- 
raised: in this case, read the distance is equal to the square root
of the difference of the abscissas raised to the square added to the difference
of the ordinates raised to the square, in symbols:

                         _________________________________________
                        /
                       / (P2x-P1x)*(P2x-P1x)+(P2y-P1y)*(P2y-P1y)
                   \  /
                    \/

Try to understand Sqr and ^ well because we will use them often later on) 


This formula is useful, for example, to find the length of a side of any polygon
when the two corners are known



2) Knowing only two points P1(Px1,Py1) and P2(Px2,Py2), we can find the
coordinates of the midpoint M(XM,YM) with the formula:

XM = (Px1 + Px2)/2

YM = (Py1 + Py2)/2

******************************************************************************
At this point, I would say that you can also do the perspective lesson, since
you are now able to represent any object in space (just
draw the edges and join them with the Blitter to form a
flat figure or a solid)
. Keep in mind, however, that with this knowledge you cannot yet rotate objects, only zoom in and out (to do this, simply increase or decrease the Z value of each point). 
To rotate a point, we need to use trigonometry, introducing cosine
and sine. These two are simply the abscissa and ordinate of a point that
has the characteristic of being on a circle with the origin as its centre

Even though what I have drawn is an irregular octagon (but what can you do
with ASCII characters, I couldn't do any better), with a little imagination
you should have an idea of what I mean. In short, the cosine is the
distance of point P from the Y-axis, while the sine is the distance of point P from 
the X-axis.By convention (but not only for that reason), the radius of the circle is
considered to be equal to 1. In this way, both the sine and the cosine will always oscillate
between values between 1 and -1 (essentially decimal numbers).
 
It should also be noted that point P also identifies an angle on the circumference,
i.e. the angle formed between the X-axis and the line passing through point P and the origin
of the axes.
For example, if we say that the sine of 30 degrees is 0.5, this means that point P,
 which, when joined to O (the origin of the axes), forms an angle of
30 degrees with the X-axis, is 0.5 away from the X-axis.
To find the cosine of the angle in question, we can make a simple 
observation based on Pythagoras' theorem (not the Coder).
For those who are not familiar with this, which is one of the main theorems of geometry, here is
a quick explanation:
given a right-angled triangle (i.e. with an angle of 90 degrees), knowing the
length of the two legs (which are the shorter sides), we can find the
hypotenuse (the longest side), knowing that this is equal to the square root
of the sum of the squares of the two legs.


                |\
                | \
                |  \
                |   \  c
              a |    \ 
                |     \
                |      \
                |       \
                |________\
                    
                    b 


In this case, a and b are the legs. To find c, we need to calculate the square root
of a*a+b*b (which we can also write as a^2+b^2).
In general, therefore:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2

Returning to the circumference we were considering, we also note here the
absence of a right-angled triangle with the abscissa and ordinate of point P as the cathetus
and the segment OP as the hypotenuse, which is practically equal to the radius, and
therefore to 1.
In the previous example, where we knew the sine of 30 degrees, we can find the corresponding cosine (which would be the abscissa):
  
                 ^
               Y |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			  ___|___
 			 /   |___\.P 
 			|    | b  |a 
 	   -------------+----+----+-------------->
 			|   O|    |             X
 			 \___|___/ 
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     |
 			     
 			  
In this case, a = 0.5 and OP (which I have not drawn for graphic reasons) is
equal to 1. Since the angle between a and b is 90 degrees, substituting the known terms
in the previous equation, we have:

1^2 = 0.5^2 + b^2

Replacing 0.5 with the fractional form 1/2, we can write:

1 = 1/2^2 + b^2

From which:

1 = 1/4 + b^2

Therefore:

b^2= 1 - 1/4

b^2= 3/4

We can conclude that b = sqr(3)/2 (sqr is simply the instruction used 
by most high-level languages to indicate the square root,
 so in our case, b is equal to the square root of 3 divided by 2)
